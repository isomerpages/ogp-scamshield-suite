<p>The national anti-scam campaign “I can ACT against scams” was launched
in January 2023 to translate awareness to action with the acronym ACT.</p>
<p>Scams can affect people from any demographic or background. Scammers are
always coming up with new tricks to prey on common human vulnerabilities.
Take these steps to safeguard yourself and your loved ones from falling
prey to scams.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The ACT (“Add, Check, Tell”) framework outlines three key actions to improve
your defences against scams.</p>

<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The ScamShield app helps to block scam calls and filter or flag scam SMSes.
With ScamShield, you can expect to receive reduced numbers of scam calls.
You can also expect fewer malicious SMSes, such as those offering fake
job offers and loans, or tricking you into clicking malicious links.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install anti-virus apps to prevent malware. Anti-virus apps which can
detect malware and malicious phishing links are keys to safeguarding your
devices and accounts. CSA has put together a list of recommended apps which
users can download to suit their needs and budget - <a href="https://www.csa.gov.sg/our-programmes/cybersecurity-outreach/cybersecurity-campaigns/the-unseen-enemy-campaign/add-scamshield-and-anti-virus-apps" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Add ScamShield and Anti-Virus Apps</u></a>.</p>

<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>When you receive a phone call or message asking for your personal information,
banking credentials, or to transfer money, always check and verify.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First, check with the organization involved. For example, if the caller/sender
claims to be from a bank, call the official hotline of the bank to verify.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the caller/sender claims to be a Government official, check with the
said agency directly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the message appears to be sent by a delivery company, and you are expecting
a delivery, check with the delivery company directly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Government agencies and banks will never send you messages with Uniform
Resource Locator to request for your personal information or banking credentials.
If in doubt, do not click on such links. Government agencies will also
not ask for your personal particulars or banking credentials over the phone,
via SMSes, or emails.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>If you suspect that you have fallen prey to a scam, call your bank or
use the bank’s mobile application to activate the emergency “kill-switch”.
This enables the bank to promptly suspend your account to prevent scammers
from transferring your funds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should also file a police report immediately via <a href="https://eservices1.police.gov.sg/phub/eservices/landingpage/police-report" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>e-report online</u></a> or
in person at the nearest <a href="https://www.sgdi.gov.sg/other-organisations/police-posts-manned-npps" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Neighbourhood Police Post</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can also share your scam encounters via the ScamShield app and/or
the ScamShield Bot. Your sharing can help prevent other potential victims
from falling prey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tell your family and friends about the latest scam trends. You can prevent
them from falling prey to scams by doing so.</p>
</li>
