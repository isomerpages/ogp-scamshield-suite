<p><strong>SCHEDULE</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Name of Service</strong>:
ScamShield&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Nature of Service</strong>:<strong> </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.1. <strong>Scope of the Service</strong>: The Service is designed to
assist with the detection of potential scams as well as providing information
on scams. Through the Service, you may:&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) access a dedicated and free informational resource on scams;&nbsp;
<br>(b) via the ScamShield app,
<br>(i) check whether suspicious calls, websites and messages have been flagged
as scams;&nbsp;
<br>(ii) filter and block calls you receive, if these are identified as potential
scam calls; and
<br>(iii) filter SMSes you receive, if these are identified as potential scam
messages; and
<br>(iv) receive push notifications about scam reports you have submitted
and scam trends; and</p>
<p>(c) via the ScamShield app or the ScamShield Helpline, report potential
scams.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.3 <strong>Access and use of the Service</strong>: This Service is available
through the ScamShield app, the ScamShield Website, the ScamShield Helpline,
or such mobile applications, websites, helplines, channels or platforms
as may be designated by us from time to time.</p>
<p>2.4. <strong>Use of the ScamShield app</strong>: Aspects of the Service
are only accessible through the ScamShield app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) The free to use ScamShield app works actively in the background of
your mobile device, to facilitate the detection, reporting and blocking
of potential scam calls, as well as filtering potential scam SMSes from
unsaved numbers not in your contact list. The application does not have
access to known data that you do not choose to share. Further, the ScamShield
App cannot access the contents of SMSes already in your inbox prior to
installation of the ScamShield app, and it cannot access your call log.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The ScamShield app uses a Machine Learning algorithm to analyse incoming
messages from unsaved senders. If the message is determined by the algorithm
to be a potential scam message, then the potential scam message will be
sent to the authorities for review. There is no personal data of the ScamShield
app user that is being shared with the authorities, and the ScamShield
app and the Service do not have any capability to track messages from individual
users.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The ScamShield app enables users to submit screenshots, call logs and
text for checks to verify if a call or message they have received is from
a verified source. If the message or call is determined by the ScamShield
app (via its algorithm) to be a potential scam, a check outcome will be
provided to the user and the potential scam message/call will be sent to
the authorities for review.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>(b)<strong> Alerts</strong>: You may receive Alerts from time to time
in relation to scams, including notifying you of the scam reports you submit
through the ScamShield app and surges in certain scams. Each Alert may
be notified by in-app notifications, mobile push notifications or any other
method of notification as may be designated by us from time to time. We
do not guarantee the delivery, timeliness or accuracy of Alerts. We reserve
the right to vary any Alert and to terminate the provision of the Content
in the Alerts at any time without giving any reason or prior notice. We
shall not be liable to you or anyone else for losses, damages, fines or
claims arising from:</p>
<p>(i) non-delivery, delayed delivery or wrong delivery of any Alert;
<br>(ii) inaccurate Content of an Alert; or
<br>(iii) use or reliance by you on the contents of any Alert for any purpose.</p>
