<p>If you suffer a monetary loss or loss of personal information, file a
police report immediately. You can do so via these methods:</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Reporting Methods</h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>File an <strong>e-report</strong> online with the <a href="https://eservices.police.gov.sg/content/policehubhome/homepage/police-report.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore Police Force</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>File a report <strong>in-person</strong> at the nearest <a href="https://www.sgdi.gov.sg/other-organisations/manned-npps" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Neighbourhood Police Centre</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<h4>What to do while filing a police report</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Website address (URL) shared by scammers</strong>
</p>
<p>If a scammer had told you to access a website to key in your banking details
or do online trading (phishing and investment scams), or asked you to download
a mobile application from a website, you can report the link by keying
in the full URL of the scam website visited, which may be from shortened
URLs, (e.g. Tinyurl, Bit.ly). Refer to your Internet browser history to
retrieve the full link. This allows for the authorities to take action
against the website.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Phone numbers</strong>
</p>
<p>If you have fallen prey to a scam, you can report the phone number used
by the scammer by entering the entire string of numbers with no spacing
in between numbers (omit dashes) in your police report. Please indicate
if the number has a ‘+’ prefix. For example: +65123456789</p>
<p>Do state the type of call made, e.g. normal call, WhatsApp, Telegram,
IMO, Viber, etc.</p>

</ul>

<p>While most platforms put in safeguards to ensure they are free from scams,
scammers can still find ways to beat the system to execute their crimes.
Thus, always pay using the platform’s payment wallet or payment options
offered by the platforms. Do not switch to making direct payment to the
seller via bank transfers to personal bank accounts, even if the seller
offers a discount.</p>
<p>If you did not receive an item you bought online, quickly report the seller
to the platform on which you met and transacted with the seller. This is
to allow the platform to take down the fraudulent seller’s account as soon
as possible.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here are some links that will help guide you to report sellers to some
platforms</p>

<p>Good cyber hygiene is increasingly important given that our data can fall
into the wrong hands, easily.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>IF YOUR ONLINE ACCOUNT IS HACKED</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Social Media Accounts</strong>
</p>
<p>The first thing to do if your social media accounts have been compromised
is to notify all your contacts. Scammers may request for personal information
or One-Time Passwords (OTPs) but never share them. Report the incident
to the respective social media platforms immediately.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How to protect your WhatsApp account:</strong>
</p>
<p>Enable the ‘Two-Step Verification’ feature by opening WhatsApp &gt;&gt;
Settings &gt;&gt; Account &gt;&gt; Two-Step Verification &gt;&gt; Enable</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Emails</strong>
</p>
<p>If your email account has been compromised or hacked, contact your email
service provider for help. If you still have access to your account, change
your password right away. Secure passwords or passphrases should contain
at least 12 characters, including numbers, symbols and a mix of capital
and lowercase letters.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Next, change your security questions and turn on two-step verification
for extra security. You may also want to warn your colleagues, family and
friends in your email list to delete any suspicious messages that came
from your account.</p>
