<h4>IF YOUR ONLINE ACCOUNT IS HACKED</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Social Media Accounts</strong>
</p>
<p>The first thing to do if your social media accounts have been compromised
is to notify all your contacts. Scammers may request for personal information
or One-Time Passwords (OTPs) but never share them. Report the incident
to the respective social media platforms immediately.</p>

<p><strong>How to protect your WhatsApp account:</strong>
</p>
<p>Enable the ‘Two-Step Verification’ feature by opening WhatsApp &gt;&gt;
Settings &gt;&gt; Account &gt;&gt; Two-Step Verification &gt;&gt; Enable</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Emails</strong>
</p>
<p>If your email account has been compromised or hacked, contact your email
service provider for help. If you still have access to your account, change
your password right away. Secure passwords or passphrases should contain
at least 12 characters, including numbers, symbols and a mix of capital
and lowercase letters.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Next, change your security questions and turn on two-step verification
for extra security. You may also want to warn your colleagues, family and
friends in your email list to delete any suspicious messages that came
from your account.</p>
