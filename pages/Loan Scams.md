<p>Victims would encounter loan advertisements on websites or received them
from scammers through social media or messaging platforms. Scammers would
request for victims' personal information, such as NRIC and bank statements
for the loan application process and require victims to pay various fees
before the loans can be disbursed. Victims would not receive the promised
loans and realise they had been scammed when the scammers continued to
demand additional payments.</p>
