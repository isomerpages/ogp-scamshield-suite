<p>Should you fall prey to a scam (i.e., suffer monetary loss or loss of
personal information), refer to each section below to protect yourself
from further losses, and to prevent other victims from being scammed.</p>

<li>
<p>Contact your bank immediately if your bank account or credit card has
been compromised, so that the bank can take immediate actions to prevent
further monetary loss.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>File a police report with these <a href="/making-a-police-report/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">information</a> online via <a href="https://eservices1.police.gov.sg/phub/eservices/landingpage/police-report" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Police Report</a>,
or in person at the nearest Neighbourhood Police Centre or Neighbourhood
Police Post. Call 999 if you require the Police’s urgent assistance. If
you have information about scams, you may share the information with the
Police via the Police Hotline at 1800-255-0000 or online via the I-Witness
e-Service (<a href="https://www.police.gov.sg/I-witness" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SPF | I-Witness (police.gov.sg</a>).</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong><em>Here's what you can do while filing a police report</em></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Website address (URL) shared by scammers</strong>
</p>
<p>If a scammer had told you to access a website to key in your banking details
or do online trading (phishing and investment scams), or asked you to download
a mobile application from a website, you can report the link by keying
in the full URL of the scam website visited, which may be from shortened
URLs, (e.g. Tinyurl, Bit.ly). Refer to your Internet browser history to
retrieve the full link. This allows for the authorities to take action
against the website.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Phone numbers</strong>
</p>
<p>If you have fallen prey to a scam, you can report the phone number used
by the scammer by entering the entire string of numbers with no spacing
in between numbers (omit dashes) in your police report. Please indicate
if the number has a ‘+’ prefix. For example: +65123456789</p>
<p>Do state the type of call made, e.g. normal call, WhatsApp, Telegram,
IMO, Viber, etc.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p><strong><em>If you received a scam call, you can take the following steps to prevent the scammers from using the number to target others.</em></strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>If you receive a scam phone call on a messaging app, do a “Report and
Block”. This ensures the app will take down the account. By doing so, you
are helping to stall the scammers from using that number to make more calls
to potential victims.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you receive a scam call via phone, block the phone number on your phone
immediately. If you are using an iPhone, you may download ScamShield app
– an app that filters scam messages and calls – and report the phone number
via the app.</p>
<p>If you receive an unexpected call with the “+” prefix, be careful. It
could be a scam. While this is not a foolproof method, it’s a good indicator
to exercise greater caution.</p>

<br>If your online account (e.g., email or social media) is compromised, notify
all your contacts, and report the incident to the respective email service
provider or social media platform. If you still have access to your account,
change your passphrase immediately. Set up two-factor or multi-factor authentication
if you have not done so earlier.</p>

<p>For e-commerce related scams, in addition to making a police report, do
also report the incident to the platform administrators. This is to allow
the platform to take down the fraudulent seller’s account as soon as possible.
Provide as much information as you can in the police report such as scammers’
WhatsApp numbers and account details, information and screenshots of the
fraudulent posts (e.g., Instagram/Facebook/TikTok advertisements or listings
/ Instagram stories).</p>
