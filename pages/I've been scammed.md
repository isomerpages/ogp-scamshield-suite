<p>If you fall for a scam (i.e. suffer monetary loss or loss of personal
information), take the following steps to protect yourself from further
losses, and help prevent other victims from being scammed.</p>
<h4><strong>Contact your bank immediately</strong></h4>
<p>If your bank account or credit card has been compromised, the bank can
take immediate actions to prevent further monetary loss.</p>
<h4><strong>File a police report</strong></h4>
<p>File a <a href="https://eservices1.police.gov.sg/phub/eservices/landingpage/police-report" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Police Report online</a> or
in person at the nearest Neighbourhood Police Centre or <a href="https://www.sgdi.gov.sg/other-organisations/police-posts-manned-npps" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Neighbourhood Police Post</a>.
<br>
<br>For urgent assistance, call 999. To report scams, you may share information
with the Police via the Police Hotline at 1800-255-0000 or online through
the <a href="https://www.police.gov.sg/I-witness" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">I-Witness e-Service</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>Inform contacts and secure accounts</strong></h4>
<p>If your online account (e.g. email or social media) is compromised, promptly
inform all your contacts and report the incident to the relevant email
service provider or social media platform.
<br>
<br>If you still have access to your account, immediately change your password.
Also consider turning on two-factor or multi-factor authentication if you
have not already done so.</p>
<h4><strong>Report to platform administrators</strong></h4>
<p>For e-commerce related scams, apart from filing a police report, it is
important to also report the incident to the platform administrators. This
lets the platform swiftly take action against the fraudulent seller’s account.
When making the police report, include as much information as possible,
such as the scammers’ WhatsApp numbers and account details, along with
information and screenshots of the fraudulent posts (e.g. Instagram/Facebook/TikTok
advertisements or listings/Instagram stories).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Remain vigilant against repeated advances from scammers. Some may exploit
their victims' vulnerabilities by impersonating authorities in an attempt
to scam them again.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>I was a victim of an online scam and was cheated of my money. Will the
Police be able to recover my money?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>A typical modus operandi by scam syndicates is to move the scammed monies
quickly between multiple bank accounts, including to overseas bank accounts.
If the money is transferred overseas, fund recovery can be challenging
as different jurisdictions have different recovery process and legislation.
The chance of recovery once the funds have been transferred out of Singapore
is very low, and it is likely that the money may no longer be recoverable.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>Why is it so challenging for the Police to recover my money if it has
been transferred out of Singapore?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Overseas accounts reside outside of Singapore’s jurisdiction and the Singapore
Police Force will not be able to exercise any legal powers to freeze or
seize the account or compel a foreign-based bank to reverse the transactions.</p>
<p>In such cases, the Police can only notify its foreign counterparts of
the incident and seek their assistance to investigate the matter. It also
depends on the laws of the foreign country and the internal business policies
of the foreign banks involved. The chance of recovery once the funds have
been transferred out of Singapore is very low, and it is likely that the
money may no longer be recoverable.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>How long does the Police take to return my money if it is recovered?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The Police will only be able to return any seized monies to victims upon
the conclusion of investigations. The amount of time it takes to complete
investigations, and correspondingly, the amount of time it takes for seized
monies to be returned to the victims, depends on many different factors
and differs across the various types of scams. For example, whether there
are multiple claimants and whether the monies are still relevant for the
purposes of investigation or court trial or other court proceedings.</p>
