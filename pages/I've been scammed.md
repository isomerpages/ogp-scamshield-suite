<p>Should you fall prey to a scam (i.e., suffer monetary loss or loss of
personal information), take the following steps to protect yourself from
further losses, and prevent other victims from being scammed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Contact your bank immediately if your bank account or credit card has
been compromised, so that the bank can take immediate actions to prevent
further monetary loss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>File a police report online via Police Report, or in person at the nearest
Neighbourhood Police Centre or Neighbourhood Police Post. Call 999 if you
require the Police’s urgent assistance. If you have information about scams,
you may share the information with the Police via the Police Hotline at
1800-255-0000 or online via the I-Witness e-Service (https://www.police.gov.sg/I-witness).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your online account (e.g., email or social media) is compromised, notify
all your contacts, and report the incident to the respective email service
provider or social media platform. If you still have access to your account,
change your passphrase immediately. Set up two-factor or multi-factor authentication
if you have not done so earlier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For e-commerce related scams, in addition to making a police report, do
also report the incident to the platform administrators. This is to allow
the platform to take down the fraudulent seller’s account as soon as possible.
Provide as much information as you can in the police report such as scammers’
WhatsApp numbers and account details, information and screenshots of the
fraudulent posts (e.g., Instagram/Facebook/TikTok advertisements or listings
/ Instagram stories).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be alert for scammers’ repeat advances. Some scammers are known to take
advantage of their victims’ vulnerabilities. They may impersonate police
officers or other authorities and approach their victims with the intention
of scamming their victims again.</p>
</li>
</ul>
