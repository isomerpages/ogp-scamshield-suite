<p>Should you fall prey to a scam (i.e., suffer monetary loss or loss of
personal information), take the following steps to protect yourself from
further losses, and prevent other victims from being scammed.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Contact your bank immediately</strong><br></h4>
<p>If your bank account or credit card has been compromised, so that the
bank can take immediate actions to prevent further monetary loss.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>File a police report</strong></h4>
<p>File a <a href="https://eservices1.police.gov.sg/phub/eservices/landingpage/police-report" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Police Report online</a> or
in person at the nearest Neighbourhood Police Centre or <a href="https://www.sgdi.gov.sg/other-organisations/police-posts-manned-npps" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Neighbourhood Police Post</a>.
For urgent assistance, call 999. To report scams, you may share information
with the Police via the Police Hotline at 1800-255-0000 or online through
the <a href="https://www.police.gov.sg/I-witness" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">I-Witness e-Service</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Online account hacked</strong></h4>
<p>If your online account (e.g., email or social media) is compromised, promptly
inform all your contacts and report the incident to the relevant email
service provider or social media platform. If you still have access to
your account, immediately change your password. Additionally, consider
enabling two-factor or multi-factor authentication if you have not already
done so.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>E-commerce scam</strong></h4>
<p>For e-commerce related scams, apart from filing a police report, it is
important to also report the incident to the platform administrators. This
enables the platform to swiftly deactivate the fraudulent seller’s account.
When making the police report, include as much information as possible,
such as the scammers’ WhatsApp numbers and account details, along with
information and screenshots of the fraudulent posts (e.g., Instagram/Facebook/TikTok
advertisements or listings/Instagram stories).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Remain vigilant against repeated advances from scammers. Some may exploit
their victims' vulnerabilities by impersonating authorities in an attempt
to scam them again.</p>
