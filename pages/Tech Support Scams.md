<p>Tech support scams typically involve scammers contacting victims via phone
calls or WhatsApp, pretending to be their acquaintance. During the conversation,
the scammers would claim that they had lost their mobile phone and changed
phone number. After establishing rapport, the scammers would capitalise
on the perceived friendship and seek money from the victims for various
reasons.</p>
<p>The common reasons offered by scammers for these “loans” were to pay contractors
for renovation fees, pay for costs relating to the opening of new businesses,
or pay vendors/suppliers. The victims would transfer money via PayNow to
bank accounts belonging to unknown persons. They would discover that they
had been scammed when they contacted their actual acquaintance and realised
that they had neither changed their contact number nor contacted them.</p>

<h3>It is likely a scam if the caller:</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Unsolicited calls, emails or pop-ups offering tech support services suggesting
your computer/device has an issue or infected with virus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demands for payments with bank transfers, gift cards or cryptocurrency</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Request for personal information (e.g., NRIC, personal banking details)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Urgently prompts you to install software or visit suspicious websites
for system review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note: Legitimate software companies will never include a helpline number
in pop-up messages</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to stay safe</h3>
<p><strong>ADD:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Anti-Malware – Ensure systems are protected by anti-malware, such as Microsoft
Defender.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configuration settings to your web browser to block pop-up windows by
default. This reduces the likelihood of encountering malicious pop-ups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refrain from clicking on pop-up notices or links within them. These can
lead to malicious websites or prompt downloads of harmful software. Consider
the use of Microsoft Edge to benefit from Defender SmartScreen to block
malicious downloads before they are downloaded.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CHECK</strong>:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Only seek technical support from reputable sources (eg. Official support
sites bearing official contact methods). Avoid engaging with unsolicited
offers for assistance that appear out of the blue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you’re unsure about the legitimacy of a pop-up notice, verify the issue
through official channels. Contact your device manufacturer, software provider
or trusted IT support for guidance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not offer any information until you have ascertained legitimacy of
the contact. Remember, reputable organizations do not reach out to you
unsolicited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Call the ScamShield Helpline (1799) to check if you are unsure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TELL:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Warn your friends and family about your scam encounter.​</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make a police report if you think you have fallen victim.</p>
</li>
</ul>
