<h4>Victim Support</h4>
<p>If you require emotional support during the investigation process, you
may request to speak to a Victim Care Officer (VCO). VCOs are volunteers
who are trained in providing emotional and practical support to victims
of crime as they undergo the criminal justice process. During the engagement,
they may share with you common signs of scams, and tips on how you can
better protect yourself from them. If you require more long-term support,
VCOs may also point you to the appropriate community resources that can
help you cope better with the emotional distress and trauma arising from
the scam incident.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This service will be available to you at various points of the criminal
justice process, from statement-recording to the court trial. If you require
a VCO to support you, please inform your IO who will make the necessary
arrangements.</p>
<h4>Community Support&nbsp;</h4>
