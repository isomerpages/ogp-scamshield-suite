<p><strong>Consider this scenario!</strong> You were added into an exclusive
investment group on Telegram by someone who claims to be an investment
planner from a company advertising their investment services in the stock
market and cryptocurrencies. By following their instructions, you can receive
quick attractive profits!</p>

<p>What was it that made you engage? Why did you not check before you responded?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Anyone can fall prey to scams!</strong> This is clear from our
crime statistics. There are, however, some amongst us, who think that they
would never fall prey and/or are not concerned about scams. A common contributing
factor to this mindset is our high internet exposure and connectivity levels.
The 2023 IMDA digital society report revealed 99% of households in Singapore
are connected to the Internet, 97% of residents have smartphones and 93%
regularly enjoy the convenience afforded by digital technology.</p>
<p>The convenience to engage in a myriad of innocuous activities online –
communicating with others, e-commerce, banking etc – are also those targeted
by scammers. As Singaporeans become more digitally savvy, some of us may
develop a feeling of overconfidence after becoming familiar with navigating
the online space and having avoided falling prey to scams to date. Some
of us may also think that we might not be the typical profile of victims
targeted by scammers – a common stereotype being the elderly. Given that
scams are ever evolving and pervasive, and scammers target our human vulnerabilities
and use our own emotions and desires (e.g., fear and greed) against us
– our familiarity with the online space and knowledge of several scam types
can only go so far.</p>
<h4><strong>Psychology of deception and social engineering</strong></h4>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>We tend to underestimate the diverse and sophisticated
tactics used by scammers. Scam scenarios are skilfully designed to catch
victims off guard and exploit moments when our defences are down. Scammers
tend to create a heighten state of emotion (e.g. fear, excitement) in their
approaches. When we are in a heightened state of emotion (i.e., psychologically
‘hot’ state), we are less able to think critically and scrutinize the situation
we are facing in detail. Consequently, we make poorer decisions, and this
makes us more susceptible to scammers’ schemes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Scammers also use effective influence tactics that targets our basic
needs and tendencies. For example, we tend to trust authority figures,
return a favour when people help us, comply to demands made in rare situations
(e.g., a limited time offer, emergency loan requests from friends), like
people who flatter us and share similarities, and our decision making is
often influenced by the majority.</p>

<h4><strong>Multiple protective actions needed to enhance our scam resilience.</strong></h4>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>We lock the doors to our homes even though crime
rates are low, and we generally feel safe in Singapore. We also wear seatbelts
when we drive, even though some amongst us may think that they are good
drivers. Such behaviours are almost second nature to us and serve to enhance
our resilience against the risks inherent in those respective contexts.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Given the design of scams and scammers’ sophisticated
tactics, mere familiarity with the online space and awareness of scams
are insufficient. We need to change our mindsets regarding our vulnerability
to scams. A recent survey by the Singapore Police Force shows that individuals
who acknowledge their vulnerability tend to keep themselves up to date
regarding the latest scam trends and adopt more protective measures.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Apart from changing our mindset, we will also need
to proactively adopt protective measures to strengthen our resilience against
scams. The adoption of these behaviours must be second nature, and such
behaviours serve to reduce the likelihood of us falling prey to scams and/or
mitigate our financial losses to scams, especially when our defenses are
down.</p>
