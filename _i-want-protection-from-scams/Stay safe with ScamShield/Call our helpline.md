<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>No, we are unable to provide any updates pertaining to frozen bank accounts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To continue receiving your salary, you may wish to consider having it
credited to another bank account which is not frozen. You may also consider
opening a new bank account either with the same bank or another bank.</p>
<p>Persons whose bank accounts are frozen as a result of being recipients
of suspected criminal proceeds can make an application to the courts to
withdraw money for reasonable living or legitimate expenses. Section 35(8)
of the Criminal Procedure Code allows the account holder to submit an application
to the courts to access their funds for the payment of basic expenses,
including any payment for basic sustenance such as food, rent, the discharge
of a mortgage, medicine, medical treatment, taxes, insurance premiums and
public utility charges, amongst others.</p>
