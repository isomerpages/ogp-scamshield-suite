<h3><strong>Reporting keeps our loved ones safe</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>If you have encountered a potential scam, report it to us so that we can
monitor ongoing scams effectively. Through reports, ScamShield can:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Alert authorities of potential scam phone numbers. Once reviewed, numbers
suspected as scams will be added to ScamShield's blocklist. This means
you'll be helping all ScamShield users receive less scam calls or messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Train our classifier with new data on emerging scams, which strengthens
its ability to detect potential scams for everyone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protect other ScamShield users from receiving the same suspected scam
as you.</p>
</li>
</ul>

this includes details like who was on the call, and who they claimed to

the enhanced ScamShield app now supports uploading message screenshots
for ease of reporting.</p>
