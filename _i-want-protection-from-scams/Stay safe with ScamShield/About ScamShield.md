<p>ScamShield is a suite of products and tools that helps defend against
scams. The suite consists of the ScamShield app (for iPhone and Android),
a website (<a href="http://www.scamshield.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.scamshield.gov.sg</a>)
with a range of anti-scam resources, and the ScamShield Helpline (reachable
at 1799).
<br>
<br>Each of these plays a crucial role in empowering individuals to fight
against scams, and protect themselves, as well as the community, from fraudulent
activities.</p>
<h3><strong>How the app works</strong></h3>
<p>Fighting scams is a collaborative effort, and the ScamShield system works
better when it constantly receives scam reports with sufficient information.
When members of the public spot or encounter scams and report them on ScamShield,
the Singapore Police Force (SPF) reviews them to help strengthen our defences.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Call blocking and SMS filtering</h4>
<p>The ScamShield app blocks calls from numbers known to be associated with
scams, and identifies SMSes that are potentially scams.
<br>Incoming calls from unknown numbers are checked against a live database
maintained by the Singapore Police Force. If the call is from a number
that has been used for scams, it will be blocked.
<br>For incoming SMSes from anyone who isn’t a saved contact, ScamShield will
determine if the SMS is a scam using an on-device algorithm. For the iOS
version, it filters these scam SMSes into the Junk folder. For Android,
a notification is sent to alert you that the SMS you just received may
be a scam.
<br>Whenever a scam message or call is detected, it is automatically sent
to SPF for review. This keeps the App updated and will help protect others
from similar scam messages and calls.

<h3><strong>Your privacy is our priority</strong></h3>
<p>We value and respect your privacy, and follow the strictest measures to
keep your information safe and confidential when you use ScamShield products.
<br>
<br>The App cannot read any SMSes you receive from contacts saved on your
phone. It only scans SMSes from unfamiliar numbers to look for any known
signs of scams.
<br>
<br>When you submit a scam encounter via the ScamShield app, the SPF can only
see the information you have submitted.</p>
