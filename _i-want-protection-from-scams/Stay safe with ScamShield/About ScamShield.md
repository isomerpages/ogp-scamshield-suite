<p>ScamShield is a suite of products and tools that helps defend against
scams. The suite consists of the ScamShield app (for iPhone and Android),
a website (<a href="http://www.scamshield.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.scamshield.gov.sg</a>)
with a range of anti-scam resources, and the ScamShield Helpline (reachable
at 1799).
<br>
<br>Each of these plays a crucial role in empowering individuals to fight
against scams, and protect themselves, as well as the community, from fraudulent
activities.</p>
<h3><strong>How the app works </strong></h3>
<p>The ScamShield app can help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Check for scams</strong>: Enter a suspicious message, link, or
phone number to check if it’s a scam. You can also upload a screenshot
of a message (received via SMS, WhatsApp, or Telegram) to check if it is
likely to be a scam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Block and filter scams</strong>: Follow step-by-step instructions
to set up your phone to block scam calls and SMSes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Submit scam reports</strong>: Include screenshots when submitting
scam reports, so it’s easier for the police to take action on them. Your
reports help expand our database of scammers, and keep our community safe.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h4>Call blocking and SMS filtering</h4>
<p>The ScamShield app blocks calls from numbers known to be associated with
scams, and identifies SMSes that are potentially scams.
<br>Incoming calls from unknown numbers are checked against a live database
maintained by the Singapore Police Force. If the call is from a number
that has been used for scams, it will be blocked.
<br>For incoming SMSes from anyone who isn’t a saved contact, ScamShield will
determine if the SMS is a scam using an on-device algorithm. For the iOS
version, it filters these scam SMSes into the Junk folder. For Android,
a notification is sent to alert you that the SMS you just received may
be a scam.
<br>Whenever a scam message or call is detected, it is automatically sent
to SPF for review. This keeps the App updated and will help protect others
from similar scam messages and calls.

<h3><strong>Your privacy is our priority</strong></h3>
<p>We value and respect your privacy, and follow the strictest measures to
keep your information safe and confidential when you use ScamShield products.
<br>
<br>The App cannot read any SMSes you receive from contacts saved on your
phone. It only scans SMSes from unfamiliar numbers to look for any known
signs of scams.
<br>
<br>When you submit a scam encounter via the ScamShield app, the SPF can only
see the information you have submitted.</p>
