<p>ScamShield is a suite of products and tools that helps defend against
scams. The suite consists of the ScamShield app (for iPhone and Android),
a website (<a href="http://www.scamshield.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.scamshield.gov.sg</a>)
with a range of anti-scam resources, and the ScamShield Helpline (reachable
