<p>ScamShield is a suite of products and tools that helps defend against
scams. The suite consists of the ScamShield app (for iPhone and Android),
a website (<a href="http://www.scamshield.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.scamshield.gov.sg</a>)
with a range of anti-scam resources, and the ScamShield Helpline (reachable
at 1799).
<br>
<br>Each of these plays a crucial role in empowering individuals to fight
against scams, and protect themselves, as well as the community, from fraudulent
activities.</p>

<h3><br><strong>Your privacy is our priority</strong></h3>
<p>We value and respect your privacy, and follow the strictest measures to
keep your information safe and confidential when you use ScamShield products.
<br>
<br>The App cannot read any SMSes you receive from contacts saved on your
phone. It only scans SMSes from unfamiliar numbers to look for any known
signs of scams.
<br>
<br>When you submit a scam encounter via the ScamShield app, the SPF can only
see the information you have submitted.</p>
