<p>Victims would receive unsolicited phone calls or in-app calls (e.g. WhatsApp
video call) allegedly from government agencies such as the Singapore Police
Force (SPF) or the Ministry of Manpower (MOM). The scammers would claim
that there were issues with the victim’s bank accounts and required additional
verification. Victims would then be asked to provide their banking or personal
information such as banking credentials and One-Time Passwords (OTPs) to
resolve these issues.</p>
<p>Victims may also be asked to show their identity cards, work permit or
their bank cards when speaking to the “SPF” or “MOM” officer over the in-app
video call. The victims would only discover that they had been scammed
when they realised that there were unauthorised transactions made from
their bank accounts.</p>
