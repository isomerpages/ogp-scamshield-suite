<p>Fake friend call scams typically involve scammers contacting victims via
phone calls or WhatsApp, pretending to be their acquaintance. During the
conversation, the scammers would claim that they had lost their mobile
phone and changed phone number. After establishing rapport, the scammers
would capitalise on the perceived friendship and seek money from the victims
for various reasons.</p>
<p>The common reasons offered by scammers for these “loans” were to pay contractors
for renovation fees, pay for costs relating to the opening of new businesses,
or pay vendors/suppliers. The victims would transfer money via PayNow to
bank accounts belonging to unknown persons. They would discover that they
had been scammed when they contacted their actual acquaintance and realised
that they had neither changed their contact number nor contacted them.</p>
