<h2><strong>Fake Friend Call Scams</strong></h2>
<p>Fake friend call scams typically involve scammers contacting victims via
phone calls or WhatsApp, pretending to be their acquaintance. During the
conversation, the scammers would claim that they had lost their mobile
phone and changed phone number. After establishing rapport, the scammers
would capitalise on the perceived friendship and seek money from the victims
for various reasons. The common reasons offered by scammers for these “loans”
were to pay contractors for renovation fees, pay for costs relating to
the opening of new businesses, or pay vendors/suppliers. The victims would
transfer money via PayNow to bank accounts belonging to unknown persons.
They would discover that they had been scammed when they contacted their
actual acquaintance and realised that they had neither changed their contact
number nor contacted them.</p>
