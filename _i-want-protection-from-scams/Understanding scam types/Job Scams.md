<p>Job scams typically involve victims being offered online jobs that could
be performed from home. They would be asked to perform tasks for a commission,
such as making advance purchases, liking social media posts, reviewing
hotels/restaurants/airlines, completing surveys, “boosting” value of cryptocurrencies,
“boosting” ratings of product listings for online merchants, or “rating”
mobile apps to improve their rankings on app stores.</p>
<p>Another “job” offered to victims entails transfer of funds to bank accounts
provided by the scammers, for a small commission. The scammers would subsequently
request higher amount of funds to be transferred, for purportedly higher
earnings. The victims would eventually realise that they had been scammed
when they failed to receive their commission, when they were unable to
withdraw the monies from the bank accounts, or when the scammers could
no longer be contacted.</p>
