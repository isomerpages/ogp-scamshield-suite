<h2><strong>Job Scams</strong></h2>
<p>Job scams typically involve victims being offered online jobs that could
be performed from home. They would be asked to perform tasks for a commission,
such as making advance purchases, liking social media posts, reviewing
hotels/restaurants/airlines, completing surveys, “boosting” value of cryptocurrencies,
“boosting” ratings of product listings for online merchants, or “rating”
mobile apps to improve their rankings on app stores. Another “job” offered
to victims entails transfer of funds to bank accounts provided by the scammers,
for a small commission. The scammers would subsequently request higher
amount of funds to be transferred, for purportedly higher earnings. The
victims would eventually realise that they had been scammed when they failed
to receive their commission, when they were unable to withdraw the monies
from the bank accounts, or when the scammers could no longer be contacted.</p>
