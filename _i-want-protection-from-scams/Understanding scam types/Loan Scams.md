<p>Victims would come across short video clips or advertisements promoting
fast cash loans while browsing social media platforms such as TikTok and
Facebook, or through their own internet searches. In some cases, victims
would receive unsolicited text messaged through SMS or WhatsApp, offering
loans.</p>
<p>Victims would then be instructed to transfer money through methods such
as iBanking transfers, ATM cash deposits, PayNow, or hand over cash in
person.</p>
<p>Victims would only realise that they had been scammed when the scammers
failed to disburse the loan as promised.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>It is likely a scam if:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The moneylending company advertises their services, as legitimate moneylenders
are prohibited from doing so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The loan application and approval process is conducted online or over
the phone rather than requiring you to visit their registered business
premises in person, which is mandatory for licensed moneylenders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Any unsolicited loan offer is a scam.</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Licensed moneylenders are not allowed to advertise their services except
through business or consumer directories (in print or online), internet
websites belonging to the licensed moneylenders, and those placed within
the approved place of business.&nbsp;</p>
