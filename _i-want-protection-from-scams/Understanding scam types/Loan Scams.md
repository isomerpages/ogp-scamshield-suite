<p>Victims would be enticed into taking up loans with attractive interest
rates but subsequently required by the loaners to pay various ‘fees’ to
secure the loans. If victims refused to pay the ‘fees’ or tried to cancel
their loan application, the scammers would use the victim’s personal data
collected by the malware to extort victims into paying the ‘fees’, for
example by threatening to expose their compromising photographs and/or
harass people in their contact list. Having been put in fear by the scammers,
victims would transfer money to local bank accounts provided by the scammers.</p>
