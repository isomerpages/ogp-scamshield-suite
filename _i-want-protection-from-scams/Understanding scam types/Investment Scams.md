<p>Victims of investment scams usually came across “investment opportunities”
through their own internet searches or via recommendations from online
friends. Once they were duped or had been enticed by the false testimonies,
they transferred funds to specified bank accounts or cryptocurrency wallets
or made payments via their bank cards for their “investments”. In some
cases, the victims would receive initial small “profits” which led them
to believe that their “investments” were genuine, enticing them to invest
more money by transferring larger amounts of monies or cryptocurrencies
to the scammers. The victims might also be deceived by the scammers’ use
of “investment” websites or apps to display their “profits” and be convinced
to invest more monies. After larger amounts of monies or cryptocurrencies
were transferred to the scammers for their “investment”, they would experience
difficulties withdrawing their earnings from their “investments” and only
then realise that they had been scammed.</p>

<h3>Common signs of phony investments are</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>High returns at low or no risk. Scams use lucrative promises to lure investors.
The greater the promised returns, the higher the risks should be. It’s
crucial to understand what you're investing in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pressure Tactics. Scammers may use limited offers, timed gifts, or rebates
to rush you into committing your money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unverified track record. Phony investment opportunities are often offered
by individuals or organisations that are not located on MAS’s listing of
registered financial institutions, representative and investor alert list.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to stay safe</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>ADD: </strong>privacy settings to your messaging apps to only
allow your contacts to add you to chat groups and avoid scammers luring
you into such fake opportunities. Be wary of investment&nbsp; opportunities
posted on social media platforms. Set security features such as 2FA for
banking apps. Set transaction limits on internet banking transactions,
including PayNow and PayLah. Money Lock for your bank accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CHECK: </strong>if the entities you are dealing with are regulated
using the following resources on the MAS Website: (i) Financial Institutions
Directory, (ii) Register of Representatives, and (iii) Investor Alert List.
Dealing with an unregulated company or agent means giving up protections
under the law.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>TELL: </strong>Report to the authorities and block the communication
chatgroup and/or social media posting/advertisement to the platform’s administrators.</p>
</li>
