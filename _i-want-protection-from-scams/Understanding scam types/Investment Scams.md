<p>Victims of investment scams usually came across “investment opportunities”
through their own internet searches or via recommendations from online
friends. Once they were duped or had been enticed by the false testimonies,
they transferred funds to specified bank accounts or cryptocurrency wallets
or made payments via their bank cards for their “investments”.</p>
<p>In some cases, the victims would receive initial small “profits” which
led them to believe that their “investments” were genuine, enticing them
to invest more money by transferring larger amounts of monies or cryptocurrencies
to the scammers. The victims might also be deceived by the scammers’ use
of “investment” websites or apps to display their “profits” and be convinced
to invest more monies.</p>
<p>After larger amounts of monies or cryptocurrencies were transferred to
the scammers for their “investment”, they would experience difficulties
withdrawing their earnings from their “investments” and only then realise
that they had been scammed.</p>

<h3>Common signs of phony investments are</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Promises of high returns at low or no risk. Scams use lucrative promises
to lure investors. The greater the promised returns, the higher the risks
should be. It’s crucial to understand what you're investing in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Involvement of pressure tactics. Scammers may use limited offers, timed
gifts, or rebates to rush you into committing your money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unverified track record. Phony investment opportunities are often offered
by individuals or organisations that are not located on MAS’s listing of
registered financial institutions, representative and investor alert list.</p>
