<p>E-commerce scams involve the sales of goods and services without physical
meet-ups. Generally, victims would come across attractive deals on online
marketplaces or social media platforms but would fail to receive the goods
or services after making payment. In some cases, the victims were sellers
who did not receive payment after delivering the goods or services to scammers
pretending to be buyers. The scammers sometimes provided victims with fake
screenshots as “proof of payment”.</p>

<h3>It is likely a scam if the seller</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Offers the item/service at ridiculously low prices for a limited time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asks you to make payment directly to them, instead of using the platform’s
secure payment option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Needs you to click on unknown URL links or install a third-party app sent
via text messages to make payment or facilitate a refund.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asks you to pay additional customs or delivery fees after the deal is
confirmed.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to stay safe</h3>
<p><strong>ADD</strong>:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Privacy settings to your messaging apps to only allow your contacts to
add you to chat groups and avoid being added into unknown chatgroups by
scammers luring you into such fake opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security features such as 2 or Multi-Factor Authentication (2FA/MFA) for
banking apps</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transaction limits on payment accounts, including PayNow and PayLah.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CHECK:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The e-Commerce platforms’ Transaction Safety Rating at <a href="http://go.gov.sg/mhatsr" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">go.gov.sg/mhatsr</a>.
Only on well-established e-commerce platforms with secure payment options.
<br>Verify the authenticity of request for additional payments (e.g. GST,
delivery fees) with e-commerce seller on the platform directly. Do not
use clickable links or QR codes provided by sellers out of the platform
to make payments/transfers as these lead to fake bank websites that phish
for your banking credentials.
<br>Never disclose your personal information, internet banking and social
media account details, and one-time passwords (OTPs) to anyone.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TELL:</strong>
