<p>E-commerce scams involve the sales of goods and services without physical
meet-ups. Generally, victims would come across attractive deals on online
marketplaces or social media platforms but would fail to receive the goods
or services after making payment. In some cases, the victims were sellers
who did not receive payment after delivering the goods or services to scammers
pretending to be buyers. The scammers sometimes provided victims with fake
screenshots as “proof of payment”.</p>

<li>
<p>Needs you to click on links or install a third-party app sent via text
messages to make payment or receive refunds​</p>
</li>
