<h2><strong>E-commerce Scams</strong></h2>
<p>E-commerce scams involve the sales of goods and services without physical
meet-ups. Generally, victims would come across attractive deals on online
marketplaces or social media platforms but would fail to receive the goods
or services after making payment. In some cases, the victims were sellers
who did not receive payment after delivering the goods or services to scammers
pretending to be buyers. The scammers sometimes provided victims with fake
screenshots as “proof of payment”.</p>

<h3>It is likely a scam if the seller</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Prices the item/service at ridiculously low prices for a limited time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asks you to make payment directly to him/her, instead of using the platform’s
secure payment option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Needs you to download third-party app or click unknown URL links to make
payment or facilitate a refund.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asks you to pay additional customs or delivery fees after the deal is

<h3>How to stay safe</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>ADD</strong>: Anti-virus app as recommended by CSA and security
features such as 2FA for your online accounts and Money Lock for your bank
accounts.
<br>Use only official banking apps downloaded from official app stores (Google
Play Store or Apple App Store)&nbsp;to make transfers or payments. Set
transaction limits on internet banking transactions, including PayNow and
PayLah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CHECK: </strong>The e-Commerce platforms’ Transaction Safety Rating
at <a href="http://go.gov.sg/mhatsr" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">go.gov.sg/mhatsr</a>.
Only on well-established e-commerce platforms with secure payment options.
<br>Verify the authenticity of request for additional payments (e.g. GST,
delivery fees) with e-commerce seller on the platform directly. Do not
use clickable links or QR codes provided by sellers out of the platform
to make payments/transfers as these lead to fake bank websites that phish
for your banking credentials.
<br>Never disclose your personal information, internet banking and social
media account details, and one-time passwords (OTPs) to anyone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>TELL: </strong>Flag any suspicious users and fraudulent transactions
to the e-commerce platforms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
