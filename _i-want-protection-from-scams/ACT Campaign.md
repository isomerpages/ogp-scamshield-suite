<p>Victims come from all demographic groups and backgrounds. Scam tactics
constantly evolve and scammers use persuasive tactics to prey on common
human vulnerabilities. However, there are preventive actions you can take,
to protect you and your loved ones against scams. The ACT (“Add, Check,
Tell”) framework outlines three key actions to improve your defences against
scams.</p>

<p>The ScamShield app helps to block scam calls and filter or flag scam SMSes.
With ScamShield, you can expect to receive reduced numbers of scam calls.
You can also expect fewer malicious SMSes, such as those offering fake
job offers and loans, or tricking you to click malicious links.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install anti-virus apps to prevent malware. Anti-virus apps which can
detect malware and malicious phishing links are key to safeguarding your
devices and accounts. CSA has put together a list of recommended apps which
users can download to suit their needs and budget - <a href="https://www.csa.gov.sg/our-programmes/cybersecurity-outreach/cybersecurity-campaigns/the-unseen-enemy-campaign/add-scamshield-and-anti-virus-apps" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Add ScamShield and Anti-Virus Apps</u></a>.
Refer to the infographics below on the tell-tale signs of a malware infection
and what to do if your device is infected.</p>

<li>
<p>When you receive a phone call or message asking for your personal information,
banking credentials, or to transfer money, always check and verify.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First, check with the organization involved. For example, if the caller/sender
claims to be from a bank, call the official hotline of the bank to verify.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the caller/sender claims to be a Government official, check with the
said agency directly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the message appears to be sent by a delivery company, and you are expecting
a delivery, check with the delivery company directly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Government agencies and banks will never send you messages with Uniform
Resource Locator to request for your personal information or banking credentials.
If in doubt, do not click on such links. Government agencies will also
not ask for your personal particulars or banking credentials over the phone,
via SMSes, or emails.</p>

<p>If you suspect that you have fallen prey to scams, call your bank or use
bank’s mobile application immediately and activate the emergency “kill-switch”.
This is a feature that the banks can suspend your account immediately to
prevent your money from being transferred away by scammers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should also file a police report immediately. You may <a href="https://eservices.police.gov.sg/content/policehubhome/homepage/police-report.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>file an e-report online</u></a>,
or in person at the nearest Neighbourhood Police Centre or Neighbourhood
Police Post.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can also share your scam encounters via the ScamShield app and/or
to the ScamShield Bot. Your sharing can help prevent other potential victims
from falling prey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tell your family and friends about the latest scam trends. You can prevent
them from falling prey to scams by doing so.</p>
