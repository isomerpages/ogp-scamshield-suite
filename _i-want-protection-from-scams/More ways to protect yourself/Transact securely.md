<h3><strong>Be wary when shopping on e-commerce sites</strong></h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>When making online purchases, check the reviews of the seller, and look
out for potential tell-tale signs of scams</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always pay using the secured payment options offered by the platforms.
Do not take transactions off-platform, especially when making payment.
A common scam tactic is to lure victims to messaging platforms such as
WhatsApp or Telegram, and direct victims to make banks transfers for items.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be wary of deals that seem too good to be true. Exercise caution when
encountering heavily discounted or unrealistic deals, as they may be indicative
of fraudulent activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the safety ratings of e-commerce platforms by referring to the
<a href="https://www.mha.gov.sg/e-commerce-marketplace-transaction-safety-ratings" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">E-commerce Marketplace Transaction Safety Ratings (TSR)</a>

<h3><strong>Safeguard banking details and lower transaction limits</strong></h3>
<p>Falling prey to scammers can have significant repercussions, including
financial loss, identity theft, and emotional distress, jeopardizing hard-earned
money and financial stability. Prioritizing safe banking practices is essential
to mitigate these risks and safeguard personal and financial well-being.
Some ways to do so include lowering your bank transaction limits, setting
a low threshold for funds transfer transaction notifications, including
for PayNow, and staying alert to all transaction notifications so that
any unauthorised payments are reported as soon as possible to increase
the chances of recovery.</p>
<h3><strong>Adopting good digital banking hygiene practices</strong></h3>
<p>Add ScamShield App and security features (e.g. enable Two-Factor Authentication
(2FA), Multifactor Authentication for banks).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refrain from giving out personal information and bank details (such as
your internet bank account usernames, passwords, OTP codes from tokens),
whether on a website or to callers over the phone.</p>
<p>Activate the emergency self-service “kill switch” to suspend your bank
account quickly if you suspect that your bank account has been compromised.</p>

<h3><strong>CPF Withdrawal Lock and online Daily Withdrawal Limit</strong></h3>
<p>If you are aged 55 and above, the default online Daily Withdrawal Limit
is automatically set at $2,000 per day.</p>
<p>If you have no immediate plans to withdraw your CPF savings, you are encouraged
to safeguard your CPF savings by activating the CPF Withdrawal Lock to
disable online withdrawals. You can do so in 3 easy steps via the <a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/ds/account-settings" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CPF account settings</a>&nbsp;after
logging on to the CPF website using your Singpass.</p>
<p>When you need to make a CPF withdrawal, you can enable online withdrawals
again by increasing the online Daily Withdrawal Limit via the CPF account
settings. You are encouraged to plan your CPF withdrawals in advance, as
this process will involve enhanced authentication measures and a 12-hour
cooling period for security purposes.</p>
<p>The online Daily Withdrawal Limit and CPF Withdrawal Lock complement CPFB’s
existing security measures, which include Singpass Two-Factor Authentication
(2FA) and ensuring that your CPF savings can only be paid to bank accounts
that are verified as belonging to you.&nbsp;You will also receive instant
notifications of any CPF withdrawals and adjustments to your online Daily
Withdrawal Limit or bank account details registered with CPFB.</p>
