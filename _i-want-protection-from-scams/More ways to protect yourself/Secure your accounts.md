<h4><strong>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) where available</strong></h4>
<p>2FA uses more than one type of information to identify who you are to
grant you access to your online account. The first factor in 2FA is usually
something that you know, such as a password, while the second factor is
usually something you have, such as a One-Time Password (OTP) from a digital
token or an SMS that is sent to your mobile device. Another form of authentication
involves biometrics, which includes fingerprints and face recognition.
This second layer of security ensures that even if hackers obtain your
password, your account is still protected if they are unable to get hold
of the second factor.</p>
<p>You can easily set up two-factor authentication (2FA) for your social
media accounts by following these links.</p>

<h4><strong>Use Strong Passphrases&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>Passphrases are passwords, but longer and made up of a string of words.
Strong passphrases are important for keeping your online accounts and personal
information safe from cybercriminals.
<br>Set a strong password containing at least 12 characters. Use five different
words that relate to a memory that is unique to you. e.g. Learnt2RIDEabikeat5.
<br>Use uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and symbols to make
it even harder to crack.
<br>You can check the strength of your passwords via <a href="https://www.csa.gov.sg/Tips-Resource/Interactive-Tools/Password-Checker" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">this link</a>.</p>

<h4><strong>Enable privacy settings for your social media and messaging accounts</strong></h4>
<p>Users should carefully manage their privacy settings, avoid accepting
friend requests or messages from unknown individuals, and refrain from
sharing personal details with unfamiliar contacts.
<br>Add privacy settings on messaging apps to avoid being added into random
chatgroups by strangers. For WhatsApp and Telegram: Go to in-app Settings
&gt; Tap on Privacy &gt; Tap on Groups/Channels &gt; Select “My Contacts”</p>
