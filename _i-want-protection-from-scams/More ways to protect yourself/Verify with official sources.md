<p>Before you click any links or act on information that you are unsure of,
always check with the official source for legitimacy.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>For investment-related situations, check that the entity is regulated
by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) as dealing with an unregulated
entity means giving up the safeguards offered under the laws administered
by MAS. Official resources to verify if an entity or individual is regulated
by MAS include the <a href="https://eservices.mas.gov.sg/fid" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Financial Institutions Directory</a>,
a list of financial institutions regulated by MAS and the regulated activities
they are authorised to provide, and the <a href="https://eservices.mas.gov.sg/rr" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Register of Representatives</a>,
which reflects individuals who conduct activities regulated by MAS. You
can also refer to <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/investor-alert-list" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MAS’ Investor Alert List</a> for
a non-exhaustive list of persons unregulated by MAS who may have been wrongly
misperceived as being licensed or authorised by MAS.</p>

<p>For property-related situations, check the <a href="https://www.cea.gov.sg/aceas/public-register/ea/1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Council for Estate Agencies (CEA) Public Register</a> to
verify that the person you are liaising with is a registered property agent.
In addition, do not transfer money for rental units until you have viewed
the unit in person. It is likely a scam if a deposit is requested even
before you have viewed the unit in person.</p>

<li>
<p>For job-related situations, check the company’s official website or contact
the company directly to verify the legitimacy of the job offer.</p>
