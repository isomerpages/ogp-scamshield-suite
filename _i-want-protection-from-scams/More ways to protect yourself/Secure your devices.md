<h4><strong>Use anti-virus software</strong></h4>
<p>Viruses, worms, Trojan horses and other forms of malware (i.e., malicious
software) can infect your devices and cause your devices to slow down or
malfunction. Cybercriminals can also deploy malware to corrupt files, steal
data, and even gain access to your social media and bank accounts.
<br>We have seen many cases where victims lost large amounts of money due
to unauthorised bank account withdrawals on mobile devices infected with
malware.&nbsp;
<br>Anti-virus apps which can detect malware and malicious phishing links
are also key to safeguarding your devices and accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not sure which security app to download? CSA has put together a list of
recommended apps which users can download to suit their needs and budget.
The apps come in free and paid versions, offering a range of features such
as malicious URL blocking and malware scanning.</p>
<p>But remember – there is no 100% protection and it is important to remain
vigilant and adopt good cyber hygiene habits to protect your devices.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>Always only download from official App Stores</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Do not download apps from unknown or unofficial sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only use app stores such as Google Play Store (Android) or Apple App Store
(iOS), as these platforms have measures in place to detect and remove malicious
apps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For apps that do not have an automatic update function, do update your
apps promptly when you receive a notification to do so. This will ensure
that you will have the most up-to-date protection against cyber threats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the developer’s reputation, number of downloads and app reviews
before downloading their apps. Stick to well-known developers where possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never download files or applications from unknown sources, and never click
on pop-up advertisements, suspicious links, or open files or email attachments
from unknown senders. Otherwise, you may unknowingly download malware into
your computers or mobile devices.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>For Android users</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>CSA and Google have introduced an enhanced security feature under Google
Play Protect. This feature blocks potentially malicious and high-risk apps
that are installed not from Google Play but from web browsers, messaging
apps or file managers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Block Incoming Calls and SMS from International Numbers</strong></h4>
<p>Worried about international scam calls and SMSes? Telcos now offer the
features to prevent calls and SMSes made via international numbers from
reaching you. Activating the feature(s) can help to safeguard against phone/SMS
scams.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What does the features do?</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>They block all incoming mobile calls and/or SMSes made from international
numbers. Depending on the feature activated, calls and/or SMSes made from
Singapore numbers while overseas (e.g. Singapore users roaming overseas
and calling home) can still be received as normal.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subscribers can activate and disable the international call and/or SMS
blocking feature(s) based on their needs. For example, a subscriber can
opt in to enable both features as a default, but disable the services when
travelling overseas and expecting calls from international numbers (e.g.
from the hotel or on-ground transport).</p>
