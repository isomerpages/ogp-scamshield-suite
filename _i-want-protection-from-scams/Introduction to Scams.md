<p>A scam is designed to trick you into giving away your money, personal
details or data by offering an attractive deal or false information.</p>

communication channels, such as via phone calls, WhatsApp messages, SMSes,

and deceive the victims, resulting in victims losing something of value
to the perpetrators (usually transferring of money or virtual credits,
or revealing personal particulars or credentials)</p>
