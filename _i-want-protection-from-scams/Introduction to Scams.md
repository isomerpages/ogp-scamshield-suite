<h2><strong>What is a scam?</strong></h2>
<p>Not all negative experiences are scams. A scam is designed to trick you
into giving away your money, personal details or data by offering an attractive
deal or false information.</p>

<p>Perpetrators would establish links with potential victims via various
communication channels, such as via phone calls, WhatsApp messages, SMSes,
social media and e-commerce platforms;</p>

and deceive the victims, resulting in victims losing something of value
to the perpetrators (usually transferring of money or virtual credits,
