<p>A scam is designed to trick you into giving away your money, personal
details, or data by offering an attractive deal or false information.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Scammers could contact potential victims through various communication
channels, such as phone calls, WhatsApp messages, SMSes, social media,
and e-commerce platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scammers may target victims who unwittingly respond to their outreach
and then deceive them, resulting in victims losing something of value to
the scammers (usually transferring of money or virtual credits, or revealing
personal particulars or credentials).</p>

<li>
<p>There is usually no face-to-face meeting between scammers and their victims
throughout the engagement process.</p>
