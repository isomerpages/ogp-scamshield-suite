<p>Viruses, worms, Trojan horses and other forms of malware (i.e., malicious
software) can infect your devices and cause your devices to slow down or
malfunction. Cybercriminals can also deploy malware to corrupt files, steal
data, and even gain access to your social media and bank accounts.</p>
<p>We have seen many cases where victims lost large amounts of money due
to unauthorised bank account withdrawals on mobile devices infected with
malware.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scammers often target victims through SMSes or phone calls. Do add the
ScamShield app which can protect you by detecting scam messages and blocking
scam calls.</p>
<p>ScamShield is an app developed by Open Government Products in collaboration
with the Singapore Police Force and the National Crime Prevention Council.</p>
<p>Anti-virus apps which can detect malware and malicious phishing links
are also key to safeguarding your devices and accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>How to Choose an Anti-Virus App</strong></h4>
<p>It is important to note that anti-virus apps from different brands have
varying functions and capabilities. Below are some factors to consider
and steps to take when choosing an anti-virus app:</p>
<h4><strong>Download from Official App Stores</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Do not download apps from unknown or unofficial sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only use app stores such as Google Play Store (Android) or Apple App Store
(iOS), as these platforms have measures in place to detect and remove malicious
apps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For apps that do not have an automatic update function, do update your
apps promptly when you receive a notification to do so. This will ensure
that you will have the most up-to-date protection against cyber threats.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Verify Application Permissions</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>When installing an app, review and grant the necessary permissions relevant
to the app’s functionality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be cautious if the app asks for excessive or unrelated permissions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Review Application Developers</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Check the developer’s reputation, number of downloads and app reviews
before downloading their apps. Stick to well-known developers where possible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Consider Apps with Malware Removal Capabilities&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>While many apps provide basic malware detection, malware removal often
remains a separate feature. Many free options can only detect and quarantine
malware, but may not offer removal options if your devices are found to
be infected.</p>
<h4><strong>Recommended Security Apps</strong></h4>
<p>Not sure which security app to download? CSA has put together a list of
recommended apps which users can download to suit their needs and budget.
The apps come in free and paid versions, offering a range of features such
as malicious URL blocking and malware scanning.</p>
<p>CSA conducted tests on the malware and phishing detection capabilities
of these apps in August this year. The methodology involved installing
the anti-virus app on a device and infecting the device with recent malware
variants to test if the app was able to detect them. Similarly, the device
was also used to access selected phishing websites to test if the anti-virus
app detected them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do note that due to iOS’ security restrictions, it is not possible for
the anti-virus app to scan other iOS apps for malware. As such, CSA could
not test their ability to detect malware on iOS devices.</p>
<p>But remember – there is no 100% protection and it is important to remain
vigilant and adopt good cyber hygiene habits to protect your devices.&nbsp;</p>

other apps in iOS devices to detect malware.</p>
