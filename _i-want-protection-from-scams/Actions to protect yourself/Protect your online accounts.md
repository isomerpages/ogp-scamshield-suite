<p>Online accounts, including email and social media accounts, are essential
for connecting with others, sharing information, and engaging in various
online activities. Examples of online accounts include email accounts (e.g.,
Gmail, Outlook) and social media accounts (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram).
These accounts are used for personal communication, professional networking,
content sharing, and staying informed about news and events.</p>
<p>Take the following measures to help safeguard your personal data, financial
information, and online reputation from malicious actors seeking to exploit
vulnerabilities for fraudulent purposes.</p>
<h4><strong>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) where available</strong></h4>
<p>2FA uses more than one type of information to identify who you are to
grant you access to your online account. The first factor in 2FA is usually
something that you know, such as a password, while the second factor is
usually something you have, such as a One-Time Password (OTP) from a digital
token or an SMS that is sent to your mobile device. Another form of authentication
involves biometrics, which includes fingerprints and face recognition.
This second layer of security ensures that even if hackers obtain your
password, your account is still protected if they are unable to get hold
of the second factor.</p>
<p>2FA is readily available for many of your online accounts, including your
email and social media accounts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Use Strong Passphrases&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>Passphrases are passwords, but longer and made up of a string of words.
Strong passphrases are important for keeping your online accounts and personal
information safe from cybercriminals.</p>
<p>Cybercriminals can use automated tools to steal your passwords. They can
conduct dictionary or brute-force attacks to guess your password by checking
it against ‘password dictionaries’, which compile lists of commonly-used
passwords and character combinations. The shorter and less complex your
password is, the quicker it is for cybercriminals to hack. For example,
the password ‘123456’ can be hacked in less than one second.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>How to Create a Strong Passphrase</strong></h4>
<p>A passphrase that is long (with at least 12 characters) and random is
harder to guess. Here’s how to create a strong passphrase that you can
remember easily.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: String together five different words that relate to a memory that is unique to you. </strong>For
example, you may have learnt to ride a bike when you were five years old.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Use uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers or symbols to make it even harder to crack. e.g. Learnt2RIDEabikeat5</strong>
</p>
<p>Do remember not to use personal information such as your name, NRIC or
birthdate, or other easily obtainable information such as those found on
your social media accounts. Ensure that your passphrase does not have an
obvious pattern and is unpredictable. Some examples include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Using commonly-used phrases e.g. maytheforcebewithyou,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capitalising the first letter of the password e.g. Livelongandprosper</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adding a number at the end e.g. password1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replacing a letter with a number or symbol e.g. p@ssw0rd</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<h4><strong>Maintain Good Password Hygiene</strong></h4>
<p>It is important that you also take steps to maintain good password hygiene:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Use different passwords for each of your online accounts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t share your passwords with anyone or write them down</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t log in to online services over unsecured Wi-Fi networks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t reveal your passwords or OTP in response to unsolicited phone calls,
emails or messages as it could be a phishing scam.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you believe that your password has been compromised, change it immediately
and check for signs of unauthorised activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Use Reputable Password Managers</strong></h4>
<p>A password manager is a software application designed to store and manage
your passwords.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using a password manager will only require you to remember the master
password that unlocks the password manager, eliminating the need to remember
multiple passwords for multiple accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select a reputable one with 2FA and features that best suit your needs.
Consider product reviews on reputable websites, and only download them
through official app stores such as the official Play Store (Android) and
App Store (iOS).</p>
