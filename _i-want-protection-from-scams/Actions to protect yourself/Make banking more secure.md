<p>Falling prey to scammers due to unsafe banking practices can have significant
repercussions, including financial loss, identity theft, and emotional
distress, jeopardizing hard-earned money and financial stability. It can
lead to unauthorized transactions, compromised personal information, and
a loss of trust in financial institutions. Prioritizing safe banking practices
is essential to mitigate these risks and safeguard personal and financial
well-being.</p>
<h3><strong>Banking Safe</strong></h3>
<p>Add ScamShield App and security features (e.g. enable Two-Factor Authentication
(2FA), Multifactor Authentication for banks and set up transaction limits
for internet banking transactions, including PayNow).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refrain from giving out personal information and bank details, whether
on a website or to callers over the phone. Personal information and bank
details such as internet bank account usernames, passwords, OTP codes from
tokens, are useful to criminals.</p>

<h3><strong>CPF Withdrawal Limit</strong></h3>
<p>A default online CPF withdrawal limit of $2,000 a day will be applied
to all CPF members aged 55 and above. &nbsp;This default daily limit can
be adjusted to any amount, including $0 and up to $200,000, at any time
online. Any increases to the daily withdrawal limit however, will be subject
to Singpass Face Verification (SFV) and a 12-hour cooling period to prevent
unauthorised adjustments.</p>
<p>Introducing a default daily limit for online CPF withdrawals is part of
CPF Board’s ongoing efforts to safeguard CPF savings against fraudulent
withdrawals online. This is on top of our existing precautionary measures,
which include SFV as a step-up authentication challenge for certain CPF
e-services. In addition, CPF members can be assured that their CPF savings
can only be paid to bank accounts that are verified as belonging to them.&nbsp;
They will also be notified immediately of any CPF withdrawals.</p>
